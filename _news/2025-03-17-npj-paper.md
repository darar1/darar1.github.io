Our [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01475-8.pdf "link to pdf") on large language modelsâ€™ clinical calculations performance is published in Natureâ€™s npj | digital medicine! Our study showed how bad LLMs are at clinical calculations, so we had to build a set of task-specific clinical calculation tools and show how giving LLMs the task-specific tools--medical calculators--reduce their incorrect calculations to below 5% (from 64% without the tools).
