I have been developing new health-tech products by applying machine learning to clinical 
and spectra data since 2018.

I am currently a ML Research Engineer at [Stanford AIM Lab](https://aim.stanford.edu) where I work with patients, 
doctors, and scientists to apply and evaluate generative and predictive models in anesthesia 
and perioperative medicine. 

I previously helped develop an at-home health-monitoring hardware called [COR](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2022/03/19/1000x-more-sensitive-than-apple-watch-cor-is-a-fitbit-for-your-blood "At-Home Blood Analyzer")
and worked on helping the state of Connecticut allocate resources in addressing 
opioid overdose epidemic with a [prediction model](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/09/05/how-telesphora-is-tackling-the-opioid-crisis-machine-learning-human-centered-design "Spatiotemporal Model of Telesphora"). 

My career started as a Clinical Research Associate at Stanford School of Medicine, 
where I ran studies evaluating digital health devices and tools 
and helped organize [Medicine X](https://medicinex.stanford.edu "The Most Discussed Academic Conference in Medicine") in 2014 and 2015, and a day-long workshop 
at the White House in 2016.
